Vector Database: FAISS is used for efficient similarity search. FAISS allows you to index and search through large datasets of embeddings using Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) methods.

Here's an overview of the embedding storage process using FAISS:

1. Generating Embeddings
Before storing data in FAISS, you need to generate embeddings from your textual data. This is typically done using a model like SentenceTransformers or any other embedding model that converts text into fixed-size vectors.
2. Preparing the Data
Each embedding corresponds to a chunk of text and is represented as a vector.
3. Choosing the Index Type
FAISS offers various indexing structures to optimize for different use cases, such as:
Flat (L2 distance): A brute-force approach that compares all vectors, best for small datasets.
IVF (Inverted File): A more efficient method that partitions the dataset into clusters, reducing the number of comparisons.
HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): A graph-based approach that efficiently handles high-dimensional data.
4. Creating the FAISS Index
After selecting an index type, you create a FAISS index and add your embeddings to it.
5. Storing the Index
FAISS indices can be stored to disk for later use. You can serialize the index and save it as a file.
6. Loading the Index
When you want to perform similarity searches, you can load the index from the saved file.
7. Querying the Index
Retrieve similar vectors (e.g., embeddings) for a query vector.
